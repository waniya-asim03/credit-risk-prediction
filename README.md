# Credit Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not using machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand how applicant details affect loan approval decisions.

## 📊 Dataset
Loan Prediction Dataset  
Features include applicant income, loan amount, education, credit history, and property area.  
Target variable: **Loan_Status** (Approved / Not Approved)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Handling missing values  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature encoding  
5. Feature scaling  
6. Model training using Logistic Regression  
7. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix  

## ✅ Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved good accuracy and was able to predict loan approval effectively.

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation in a real-world credit risk problem.
