# Credit Risk Prediction

📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not using Machine Learning.  
The objective is to analyze applicant details and understand the key factors that influence loan approval decisions.

📊 Dataset  
The project uses the Loan Prediction dataset.

Features include:
- ApplicantIncome  
- CoapplicantIncome  
- LoanAmount  
- Loan_Amount_Term  
- Credit_History  
- Education  
- Self_Employed  
- Property_Area  

Target Variable:
- Loan_Status (Approved / Not Approved)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

⚙️ Project Workflow  
1. Data Loading and Understanding  
2. Handling Missing Values  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Encoding  
5. Feature Scaling  
6. Model Training using Logistic Regression  
7. Model Evaluation (Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix)

📈 Results  
The Logistic Regression model achieved strong performance in predicting loan approval status.  
The model successfully learned patterns from applicant financial and demographic information.

📚 Learning Outcomes
